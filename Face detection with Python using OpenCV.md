# Face detection with Python using OpenCV

This tutorial will introduce you to the concept of object detection in Python using OpenCV library and how you can utilise it to perform tasks like Facial detection.

## Introduction
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualise human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of [object detection technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection) that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection technology has gained a lot of importance in fields like photography, security and marketing.

## Overview

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/OpenCV-Python/Logo.png)


[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) was started at Intel in the year 1999 by **Gary Bradsky** . The first release came a little later in the year 2000.  OpenCV essentially  stands for **Open Source Computer Vision Library**. Although it is written in optimized C/C++, it has interfaces for Python and Java along with C++. OpenCV boasts of a strong user base all over the world with its use increasing day by day due to surge in computer vision applications.

OpenCV-Python is the python API for OpenCV. You can think of it as a python wrapper around the C++ implementation of OpenCV. OpenCV-Python is not only fast (since the background consists of code written in C/C++) but is also easy to code and deploy(due to the Python wrapper in foreground). This makes it a great choice to perform computationally intensive programs.


## Installation
OpenCV-Python supports all the leading platforms like Mac OS, Linux and Windows. There are more than one way in which OpenCV-python can be installed.

 **From pre-built binaries and source** : 

Please refer the detailed documentation [here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html) for windows and for Mac, [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/12/19/install-opencv-3-on-macos-with-homebrew-the-easy-way/).

[**Unofficial** pre-built OpenCV packages for Python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).

Packages for standard desktop environments (Windows, macOS, almost any GNU/Linux distribution)

-   run  `pip install opencv-python`  if you need only main modules
-   run  `pip install opencv-contrib-python`  if you need both main and contrib modules (check extra modules listing from  [OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/))


You can either use Jupyter notebooks or any Python IDE of your choice for writing the scripts. The notebook can be downloaded from [here]().

# <a name="images-as-arrays"></a>Images as Arrays

An image is nothing but a standard Numpy array containing pixels of data points. More the number of pixels in an image, the better is its resolution. You can think of pixels to be tiny blocks of information arranged in form a 2 D grid and the depth of a pixel refers to the colour information present in it. In order to be  processed by a computer, an image needs to be converted into a binary form. The colour of an image can be calculated as follows:

      Number of colours/ shades = 2^bpp where bpp represents bits per pixel.

Naturally, more the number of bits/pixels , more possible colours in the images. The following table shows  the relationship more clearly. 

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Images%20as%20Arrays/Bits%20per%20pixels.png)

---
###  Let us now have a look at the representation of the different kinds of images:

## Binary Image

A binary image consists of 1 bit/pixel and so can have only two possible colours i.e black or white. Black is represented by the value 0 while 1 represents white.
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Images%20as%20Arrays/binary%20image.png)

## Grayscale image
A grayscale image consists of 8 bits per pixel. This means it can have 256 different shades where 0 pixel will represent black colour while 255 denotes white. For example, the image below shows a grayscale image represented in the form of an array . A grayscale image has only 1 channel  where channel represents dimension.

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Images%20as%20Arrays/graysclale.png)

## Coloured image

Coloured images are represented as a combination of Red, Blue and Green colours and all the other colours can be achieved by mixing these primary colours in correct proportions.

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Images%20as%20Arrays/Primary%20Colours.png)

[source](https://www.howtosmile.org/resource/smile-000-000-002-723) 

A coloured image  also consists of 8 bits per pixel. As a result , 256 different shades of colours can be represented with 0 denoting black and 255 white. Let us look at the famous coloured image of a mandrill which has been cited in many image processing examples.


![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Images%20as%20Arrays/mandrill_colour.png)

If we were to check the shape of the image above, we would get:

    Shape
    (288, 288, 3)
    288 : Pixel width
    288 : Pixel height
    3: color channel

This means we can represent the above image in the form of three dimensional array.

# <a name="images-and-opencv"></a>Images and OpenCV
before we jump into process of face detection , let us learn some basics about working with OpenCV. In this section we will perform simple operations on images using OpenCV like opening images,  drawing simple shapes on images and interacting with images through callbacks. This is necessary to create a foundation before we move towards the advanced stuff. 

## Importing Images in OpenCV

### Using Jupyter notebooks
**Steps:**
* **Import the necessary libraries**
   
``` 
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

* Read in the image using **imread** function. The image used in this section can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/opening%20images%20with%20opencv/mandrill_colour.png)

```
img_raw = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
```
*  **The type and shape of the array.**
```
type(img_raw)
numpy.ndarray

img_raw.shape
(1300, 1950, 3)
```
Thus, the .png image gets transformed into a numpy array with a shape of 1300x1950 and has 3 channels.
* **viewing the image**
```
plt.imshow(img_raw)
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/opening%20images%20with%20opencv/mandrill_blue.png)

What we get as a output is a bit different in terms of colour . We expected a bright coloured image but we obtain is an image with some bluish tinge. That happens because OpenCV and matplotlib have different orders of primary colours. Whereas OpenCV reads images in form of B,G,R, matplotlib on the other hand follows the order of R,G,B. Thus, when we read a file through OpenCV, we read it as if it contains chanels in the order of blue, green and red. However, when we display the image using matplotlib, the red and blue channel gets swapped and hence the blue tinge. To avoid this issue, we will transform the channel to how matplotlib expects it to be using cvtColor function.
```
img = cv2.cvtColor(img_raw, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
plt.imshow(img_rgb)
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/opening%20images%20with%20opencv/mandrill_colour.png)

### Using Python Scripts
Jupyter Notebooks are great for learning but when dealing with complex images and videos, we need to display them in their own separate windows. In this section we will be executing the code as a .py file. You can use Pycharm, Sublime or any IDE of your choice to run the script below.

```
import cv2
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
while True:
	cv2.imshow('mandrill',img)

	if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == 27:
		break


cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
In this code, we have a condition  and the image will only be shown if the condition is true. Also, to break the loop, we will have two conditions to fulfill:
* The **[cv2.waitKey()](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_image_display/py_image_display.html)** is a keyboard binding function. Its argument is the time in milliseconds. The function waits for specified milliseconds for any keyboard event.If you press any key in that time, the program continues.
* The second condition pertains to the pressing of the Escape key on the keyboard.
Thus, if 1 millisecond has passed and the escape key is pressed, the loop will break and program stops.
* **[cv2.destroyAllWindows()](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_image_display/py_image_display.html)**  simply destroys all the windows we created. If you want to destroy any specific window, use the function  **cv2.destroyWindow()** where you pass the exact window name as the argument.

## Savings images
After some operations has been done on the images, we can save them in the working directory as follows:

    cv2.imwrite('final_image.png',img)
where, final_image is the name given to the new image .

---

## Basic Operations on Images
In this section we will learn how we can draw various shapes on an existing image  just to get a flavour of working with OpenCV.

### Drawing on Images

* Begin by importing necessary libraries
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import cv2
```
* Create a black image which will act as a template .
```
image_blank = np.zeros(shape=(512,512,3),dtype=np.int16)
```
* Display the black image
```
plt.imshow(image_blank)
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Drawing%20on%20Images/Blank%20image.png)

### Function & Attributes

The generalised function for drawing shapes on images is:
```
cv2.shape(line, rectangle etc)(image,Pt1,Pt2,color,thickness)
```

There are some common arguments which are passed in function to draw shapes on images:

 - Image on which shapes are to be drawn 
 - co-ordinates of the shape to be drawn from Pt1(top left) to Pt2(bottom right) 
 - color : The colour of the shape that is to be drawn. It is passed as a tuple eg:
   `(255,0,0)` .  For grayscale it will be the scale of brightness.
 - Thickness of the geometrical figure.

#### 1. Straight Line
Drawing a straight line across an image requires specifying the points , through which the line will pass. 
```
**# Draw a diagonal red line with thickness of 5 px**
img = cv2.line(img,(0,0),(511,511),(255,0,0),5)
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Drawing%20on%20Images/Red%20line.png)

```
**# Draw a diagonal green line with thickness of 5 px**
img = cv2.line(img,(0,0),(511,511),(0,255,0),5)
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Drawing%20on%20Images/green%20line.png)

#### 2. Rectangle
For a rectangle, we need to specify the top left and the bottom right co-ordinates. 
```
**#Draw a blue rectangle with thickness of 5 px**

rectangle= cv2.rectangle(img,(384,0),(510,128),(0,0,255),5)
plt.imshow(rectangle)
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Drawing%20on%20Images/rectangle.png)

#### 3. Circle
For a circle, we need to pass its centre co-ordinates and radius value. Let us draw a circle inside the rectangle drawn above
   
 ```  
 img = cv2.circle(img,(447,63), 63, (0,0,255), -1)
 plt.imshow(circle)
 # -1 means we need a filled circle
```

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Drawing%20on%20Images/circle.png)

### Writing on Images
Adding text to images is also similar like drawing shapes on them. But you need to specify certain arguments before doing so:
* Text to be written
* co-ordinates of the text . The text on an image begins from bottom left direction.
* Font type  and scale. A lot of fonts are available and you can choose the specific types.
* Other attributes like color, thickness and line type. Normally the line type that is used is  `lineType  =  cv2.LINE_AA`.

```
font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX
text = cv2.putText(img,'OpenCV',(10,500), font, 4,(255,255,255),2,cv2.LINE_AA)
plt.imshow(text)
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Drawing%20on%20Images/text.png)

These were the minor operations that can be done on images using OpenCV. Feel free to expeiment with the shapes and text.

# <a name="face-detection"></a>Face Detection

## Overview

Face detection is a technique that identifies or locates human faces in digital images. A common example of face detection occurs when we take photographs through our smartphones and it instantly detects faces in the picture. Face detection is different from Face recognition. Face detection simply detects the presence of faces in an image while facial recognition involves identifying whose face it is. In this article we shall only be dealing with the former.

Face detection is performed by using classifiers. A classifier is essentially an algorithm that decides whether a given image is positive(face) or negative(not a face). A classifier needs to be trained on thousands of images with and without faces. Fortunately, OpenCV already has two pre-trained face detection classifiers, which can readily be used in a program. The two classifiers are:
* Haar Classifier and 
* Local Binary Pattern([LBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_binary_patterns)) classifier.

In this article, however  we will only discuss about the Haar Classifier.

## Haar feature-based cascade classifiers

[Haar-like features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature) are  digital image features used in object recognition . They owe their name to their intuitive similarity with [Haar wavelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet "Haar wavelet") and were used in the first real-time face detector. **Paul Viola** and **Michael Jones** in their paper titled ["Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features"](http://wearables.cc.gatech.edu/paper_of_week/viola01rapid.pdf) used the idea of  Haar feature classifier based on the the Haar wavelets. This classifier is widely used for tasks like face detection in computer vision industry. 

Haar cascade classifier employs a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This can be attributed to three main [reasons](http://wearables.cc.gatech.edu/paper_of_week/viola01rapid.pdf):
* Haar classifier employs ***'Integral Image'*** concept which allows the features used by the detector to be computed very quickly.
* The learning algorithm is based on [***AdaBoost***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost). It selects a small number of important features from a large set and gives highly efficient classifiers.
* More complex classifiers are combined to form a '***cascade***' which discard any non face regions in an image , thereby spending more computation on promising object-like regions.

Let us now try and understand how does the algorithm actually work on images.

### Haar features
After the huge amount of training data (in form of images) is fed into the system, the classifier begins by extracting Haar features  from each image. Haar Features are kind of convolution kernels which basically detect whether a suitable feature is present on an image or not.

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Face%20Detection/Haar%20Features.png)

[source](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf)

These Haar Features are like windows and are placed upon images to compute a single feature. The feature is essentially a single value obtained by subtracting the sum of the pixels under the white region and that under the black. The process can be easily visualised in the example below.

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Face%20Detection/Haar%20feature%20extraction.png)

For demonstration purpose, let's say we are only extracting two features, hence we have only two windows here. The first feature relies on the point that the eye region is darker than the adjacent cheeks and nose region. The second feature focuses on the fact that eyes are kind of darker as compared to the bridge of the nose. Thus , when the feature window moves over the eyes, it will calculate a single value. This value will then be compared to some threshold and if it passes that it will conclude that there is an edge here or some positive feature.

### Integral Images
The algorithm proposed by Viola Jones uses a 24X24 base window size and that would result in more than 
180,000 features in this window. Imagine calculating the pixel difference for all the features? The solution devised for this computaionally intensive process is to go for  **Integral Image** concept. The integral image means that to find the sum of all pixels under any rectangle, we simply need the four corner values.

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Face%20Detection/Integral%20Image.png)

[source](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf)

This means, to calculate sum of pixels in any feature window, we donot need to individually sum them up. All we need is to calculate the integral image using 4 corner values. The example below will make the process clear.
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/Face%20Detection/Integral%20Image%20calculation.png)

[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table)

### Adaboost
As pointed out above, more than 180,000 features values result within a 24X24 window. However, not all features are useful for identifying face. To only select the best feature out of the entire chunk , a machine learning algorithm called **Adaboost** is used. What it essentially does is that it selects only those features that help to improve the classifier accuracy.It does so by constructing a strong classifier  which is a linear combination of a number of weak classifiers. This reduces the number of features drastically to around 6000 from around 180,000.

### Cascading
Another way by which Viola Jones ensured that the algorithm performs fast is by employing a **cascade of classifiers**. The cascade classifier essentially consists of stages where each stage consists of a strong classifier. This is beneficial since it eliminates the need to apply all features at once on a window. Rather, it groups the features into separate sub windows and  the  classifier at each stage determines whether or not the sub -window is a face. In case, it is not , the sub-window is discarded along with the  features in that window. If the sub-window moves past the classifier, it continues to the next stage where second stage of features are applied. The process can be understood with the help of the diagram below.

## Face Detection with OpenCV-Python

Now we have a After fair idea about the intuition and the process behind Face recognition. Let us now use OpenCV library to detect faces in an image. 

### Load the necessary Libraries
```
import numpy as np
import cv2 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

### Loading the image to be tested in grayscale
We shall be using this image:
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/data/baby1.jpg)

```
#Loading the image to be tested
test_image = cv2.imread('data/baby1.jpg')
 
#Converting to grayscale
test_image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(test_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Displaying the grayscale image
plt.imshow(test_image_gray, cmap='gray')
Since we know that OpenCV loads an image in BGR format so we need to convert it into RBG format to be able to display its true colours. Let us write a small function for that.
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/data/baby1_gray.png)

Since we know that OpenCV loads an image in BGR format so we need to convert it into RBG format to be able to display its true colours. Let us write a small function for that.
```
def convertToRGB(image):
    return cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
```


###  Haar cascade files
OpenCV comes with a lot of pre-trained classsifiers. For instance there are classifiers for smile, eyes,face etc. These come in the form of xml files and are located in  `opencv/data/haarcascades/`  folder. However, just to make things simple, you can also access them from [here](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/tree/master/data/haarcascades). Download the xml files and place them in data folder in the same working directory as the jupyter notebook.


### Loading the classifier for frontal face

     haar_cascade_face = cv2.CascadeClassifier('data/haarcascade/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

###  Face detection
We shall be using the **detectMultiscale** module of the classifier. This function will return a rectangle with co-ordinates(x,y,w,h) around the detected face. This function has two important parameters which have to be tuned according to the data.
* **scalefactor** 
 In a group photo, there may be some faces which are near the camera than others. Naturally, such faces would appear bigger than the ones behind. This factor compensates for that.

* **minNeighbors**
This parameter specifies the number of neighbours a rectangle should have to be called a face. You can read more about it [here.](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4.13.2/modules/objdetect/doc/cascade_classification.html#cv2.CascadeClassifier.detectMultiScale)

```
faces_rects = haar_cascade_face.detectMultiScale(test_image_gray, scaleFactor = 1.2, minNeighbors = 5);

# Let us print the no. of faces found
print('Faces found: ', len(faces_rects))

Faces found:  1

```
Our next step is to loop over all the co-ordinates it returned and draw rectangles around them using Open CV. We will be drawing a green rectangle with thicknessof 2

```
for (x,y,w,h) in faces_rects:
     cv2.rectangle(test_image, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
  ```      
        
Finally, we shall display the original image in coloured to see if the face has been detected correctly or not.
```
#convert image to RGB and show image

plt.imshow(convertToRGB(test_image))
```
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/data/baby1_output.png)
Here, it is. We have successfully detected the face of the baby in the picture. Let us now, create a generalised function for the entire face detection process.

### Face Detection with generalised function
```
def detect_faces(cascade, test_image, scaleFactor = 1.1):
    # create a copy of the image to prevent any changes to the original one.
    image_copy = test_image.copy()
    
    #convert the test image to gray scale as opencv face detector expects gray images
    gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image_copy, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Applying the haar classifier to detect faces
    faces_rect = cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_image, scaleFactor=scaleFactor, minNeighbors=5)
    
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces_rect:
        cv2.rectangle(image_copy, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 15)
        
    return image_copy
```    
    
### Testing the function on new image
This time test image is as follows:
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/data/baby2.jpg)
```
  #loading image
  test_image2 = cv2.imread('baby2.jpg')
        
  # Converting to grayscale 
  test_image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(test_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
  # Displaying grayscale image
  plt.imshow(test_image_gray, cmap='gray')
```       
![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/data/baby2_gray.png)


    #call the function to detect faces
    faces = detect_faces(haar_face_cascade, test_image2)
        
     #convert to RGB and display image
     plt.imshow(convertToRGB(faces))

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/data/baby2_output.png)

### Testing the function on a group image
Let us now see if the function works well on a group photograph or not. The picture that we shall be using is the one below:
![Indian Women Cricket Team](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/data/group.jpg)

    #loading image
    test_image2 = cv2.imread('group.jpg')
    
    #call the function to detect faces
    faces = detect_faces(haar_cascade_face, test_image2)
    
    #convert to RGB and display image
    plt.imshow(convertToRGB(faces))

![](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/blob/master/data/group_output.png)

# <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion

In thi tutorial we learnt about the concept of face detection using Open CV in Python using Haar cascade. There are a number of detectors other than face, which can be found in the library. Feel free to experiment with them and create detectors for eyes, entire body etc.
